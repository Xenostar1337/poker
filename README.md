Simple Poker Trainer

Start with displaying preflop hand and statistics.
Call, Fold, Raise buttons.

Eventually add more features, display others' cards, play a basic poker hand, then possibly a game.


Still need to add some button functionality and input for how many decks to use. 
Add stats and info on hands.
